## Step 4 - Building a web app in Django

One of the goals we decided at the start of this project was to learn a new language - Python seemed the obvious choice since the project revolved around machine learning, and it's the language of choice for many ML libraries (for example, it's the only fully supported language for tensorflow). When it came to creating a web app to interact with out model, we were keen to continue building our knowledge of Python rather than sticking with a known framework such as Rails, so we picked Django to build the app.
